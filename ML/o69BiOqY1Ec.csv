@Dermacrosis,"9:49 I am guessing he was born after the separate vaccines for MMR that I had as a child, I didn't get the combined until it was a ""booster"", and I caught Mumps because with the separate vaccines there is a chance they may not take. The same applied with the hepatitis vaccination, which is mandatory for student nurses over here, if it didn't take then your career was over in nursing and it was only a minority of people that happened with in my intake of 220 only 3 where removed for this. Ten times more quit because of how tough the career was."

@wilddeath1,what do the flags raised mean?

@Littlemissmirrorball,A nurse being an antivax is crazy
@HardThingsPodcast,"I love   De Mike and i think he is so articulate and compassionate, I have been watching his channel and he often has criticised other doctors and healthcare individuals. I think  this episode was so difficult for me to watch because the amount of over generalization of the antivaxxers is harmful. As a therapist, it is becoming more and more of an issue that people can hop on social media call themselves an expert and then get people on board. I see a lot of clients in my office now that say they have  autism and adhd and this and that (some do but not all)  and they said they know bc of tik tok and social media but then when I hear that and say well we have tests for some things they dont want the tests.... Another word that gets thrown around a lot is Narcisist  if you look up how many people actually have NPD  its not  to the level social media throws out. the misinformation that is talked about in this video is running rampant about so many issues now with little to no empirical data and people think that saying ""studies show"" without actually being able to provide the study./...  GREAT JOB Dr MIKE  you're the GOAT of the episode!"
@drsanjayanand,Analytic thinking is in short supply with non-scientists it seems
@lorrainecasazza7073,You can see Dr. Mike becoming more and more despondent as the session goes on and he realizes there is no amount of rational argument that will persuade these people and there is nothing he can do to help them.

@jaytorres5892,"I feel so bad for Dr Mike, I have so much respect for him staying calm and respectful. I saw a video reviewing this video, and the few clips I saw sent me through the roof!

@ChefMimsy,"The one thIng that strikes me  most, is how little these people understand about how to examine data, or even how to read a paper about a study. They don't understand what the data measures, where it came from, how it was collected and how these things affect the accuracy of the data. Also, they don't know enough about biology or medicine or science in general and they lack the ability to, even on a superficial level, determine if the study they're referring to has any actual validity at all. So, they end up repeating whatever their favorite politician or news broadcaster or internet influencer has pulled out of their butts. 
I don't expect everyone to have the same level of science understanding that I do. And I've only got a Bachelor's degree from 1976, so my knowledge is relatively rudimentary. However, if you refuse to listen to the credentialed physicians who are well studied in this field, you will continue not only being ignorant about the topic, you'll continue spreading misinformation, possibly helping to enable negative outcomes for people you claim to care about.

If they don't have the ability to understand the topic, why do they so easily accept the opinions of people who also are ignorant on the subject? Too many people can't accurately describe their own medical issues- how can they so easily accept what other non-medically-educated people's ideas about the ""facts""?"

@amandalynn007,"40:33 I have so much respect for Dr.Mikes conduct talking to people. This is a great example of juxtaposition when trying to reach a patient. I have only just started picking up on this hidden skill set, after watching how the Dr, I work with, handles his people. You have to change the approach while enforcing your findings. The goal isn‚Äôt to shame anyone, it‚Äôs to inform them to really help them."

@david.the.disaster,The countdown system is so silly and chaotic. Looks bad for people to be sprinting and fighting for a chair. Just give everyone a ticket number and go around the circle one at a time and the individuals can pass or step up. Go around in a circle and everyone can participate. Otherwise its just clickbait/rage bait nonsense
@SeanAndCJShow,You people in the comments section are fools like this doctor.

@SmittyD33,Small pox Polio rabies hep b etc we got rid of most of these with vaccines
@Legal-Canadian,23:27  This lady feels insufferable and not open to any changes. Almost everyone before her seemed to be inquisitive and questioning but this lady seems to have come here with an agenda and nothing Dr.Mile could have said would have changed her mind. Everybody has seen at least one study that is supporting their worldview but unless it has been repeated multiple times from multiple sources it is basically useless.

@fernandaaliaga4095,"So funny seeing that every time the angry girl spoke, the screen was full of fact checks lol 
There's a ton of studies but not all of them meet the standars of population, the way of filtering participants, etc. We need to actually question the information after we read, a cohort analysis of 100 participants can't be used to support World Guidelines, that's why we classify the information with levels of evidence before implementing changes based on those studies."

@_melodyx,DR MIKEEEE
@shelbynichole32,He should switch from family medicine to psychiatry because his therapy skills are off the charts üòÇ
@absurdumm,I kind of hate it when on occasion they vote off the person just after they finish speaking and then only one person gets up to go to the chair---the others just pretend to get up and sit down whenever another person actually makes a move. It makes me feel like they just don't want to hear him speak; like they let one of their own say one thing and then usher it off to the next guy and Dr. Mike is just sat there in a position where he just got done complimenting and applauding his opponent and never gets a chance to actually counterargue. It's set up so that it looks like he's corroborating what they're saying.
@lobete,Everyone came up to the chair with a speech in hand and then flags go up before half of the claims are addressed.  It would be great if moderators actually let the Doctor actually address the things said.
@CMurphMobile,Let the doctor talk! This is a big problem! Their talking at Dr. Mike instead with him

@slipstreammonkey,We lose when you entertain instead of educate. Does jubilee vet anyone whether they have the ability to make a single statement and back it up with a single point of evidence. Is that too high a bar?

@danielking1795,I'd be curious to know how many anti-vaxxers who see financial gain as the primary motivation behind all practitioners of Western medicine see that motive being alleviated if we had universal health care?
