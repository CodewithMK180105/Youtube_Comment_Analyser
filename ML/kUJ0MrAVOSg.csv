@ravicharles5192,"One can relate to Aaron Eckhart and Liana Liberato as father - daughter and the young actress steals our hearts with caring as well as rebellious daughter. This action movie unfortunately did not do well at the box office. Had it been a hit, we would have had more decent
action thrillers with family values . I especially enjoyed the dialogue when he tells her daughter : "" When we were kids - that was some hundred years ago - we show our report cards to our parents. """
